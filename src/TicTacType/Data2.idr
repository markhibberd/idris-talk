-- TIC TAC TYPE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

{- This program represents a game of Tic Tac Type in Idris, really
   it should be called Naughts and Crosses, but we shall let this
   language attrocity slide in the name of a good pun. -}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PLAYERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

{- There are two players, X and O, who each play in turn. -}

data Player = X | O

instance Show Player where
  show X = "x"
  show O = "o"

instance Eq Player where
  X == X = True
  O == O = True
  X == O = False
  O == X = False


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CELLS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

{- A cell is a position in the game. A cell may be either occupied by a
   player or unoccupied -}


data Cell = Occupied Player | Unoccupied

instance Show Cell where
  show (Occupied p) = show p
  show Unoccupied     = "_"

instance Eq Cell where
  (Occupied a) == (Occupied b) = a == b
  (Occupied _) == Unoccupied = False
  Unoccupied == (Occupied _) = False
  Unoccupied == Unoccupied = True


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- POSITIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

{- In our default 3x3 game, positions are the finite set of naturals less
   than 9, which index onto the board from left to right, top to bottom.
   i.e.

     0 | 1 | 2
    -----------
     3 | 4 | 5
    -----------
     6 | 7 | 8

 -}


Position : Type
Position = Fin 9

{- But given that this is kind of confusing way to deal with identifying
   a position, we also have these convenience definitions that let us
   treat a co-ordinate as a literal position.
   i.e.

     nw | n | ne
    -------------
     w  | c | e
    -------------
     sw | s | se

 -}


{- North-West, or the Top-Left corner position. -}

nw = 0

{- North, or the Top-Center position. -}
n : Position
n = 1

{- North-East, or the Top-Right corner position. -}
ne : Position
ne = 2

{- West, or the Left-Center position. -}
w : Position
w = 3

{- Center position. -}
c : Position
c = 4

{- East, or the Right-Center position. -}

sw = 6

{- South, or the Bottom-Center position. -}
s : Position
s = 7

{- South-East, or the Bottom-Right corner position. -}

se = 8

-- THE BOARD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

{- The board is a 3x3 grid represented as a Vector of length 9. This
   limits us to the default size, however it could easily be extended
   with limited effect on the rest of the program (excepting the algorithm
   that determines a win). -}

valid' : Vect 9 Cell -> Bool
valid' board =
  let xs = sum . map xToInt  $ board in
  let ys = sum . map oToInt  $ board in
  xs == ys || xs == (S ys) where

  xToInt Unoccupied = 0
  xToInt (Occupied X) = 1
  xToInt (Occupied O) = 0

  oToInt Unoccupied = 0
  oToInt (Occupied X) = 0
  oToInt (Occupied O) = 1


data Board : Type where
  B : (b : Vect 9 Cell) -> {default oh prf : so (valid' b) } -> Board

instance Eq Board where
  (B a) == (B b) = a == b

instance Show Board where
  show (B [nw, n,  ne,
           w,  c,  e,
           sw, s,  se]) =

{- Next, we will define a bunch of useful combinators for working with
   boards. Conveniently we get to define these at the value level even
   though we will end up using them on the type level most of the time.  -}

{- We want a data structure to carry the proof that a move is valid for a given
   board, so we can use it later on. This is more useful than the Bool above. -}

   depending on the constraints of `isValidMove`. -}

  toMaybe (isValidMove position player board) (IsValidMove position player board bboard)

   valid move if we can prove it. -}

-- Lets run a validate move and produce a new board.

-- THE GAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
